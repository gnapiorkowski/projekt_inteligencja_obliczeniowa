Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    rain has wrinkled shiny puddles what's the use of trying
something was to happen someday you're crying
wind is rocking naked tree tops whispers in the sky are crawling
let me give up loving you you're sobbing

let me give up loving you
let me drop that love forever
let me let me begin to disdain you

let me give up loving you
let me drop that love forever
let me let me begin to disdain you

time has frozen on the marshes cauting them in foggy red shade
and you had me look at your hands bloodstained
what you did was like a nightmare there's no longer pity for you
there's no pardon no forgiveness how I want to learn to hate you

let me give up loving you
let me drop that love forever
let me let me begin to disdain you

rain has wrinkled shiny puddles it was to be different
something was to save us from this torment
bitter taste of bread that we share kills the hope in other people
they will be ashamed of dreaming how I want to learn to hate you

let me give up loving you
let me drop that love forever
let me let me begin to disdain you
