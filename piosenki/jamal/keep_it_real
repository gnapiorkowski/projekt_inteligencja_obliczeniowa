Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    Yo look who just jumped up on the scene 
Pocket full of green but in leather and all 
I be's that nigga named Jamal 
Mackin' hoes in the tight clothes with pretty toes 
Kickin' flows for all the rowdy bros and it goes look 
1 2 to the breaker 1 9 9 5 
Jamal representin' keep it live 
It don't matter how I come on these funk raw tracks with raps 
We bout to still make snaps 
We got bitches for days, rich as it pays 
Damn shits changed since back in the days, get money 
And my mouth is where the blunt stays blazed 
And I get dazed to kick a phrase to amaze 
I'm gettin' busier, leavin' hoes dizzier 
Than they even been with the grown men 
Is he a straight looney type of nigga 
That'll drop the temperature? 
Bitch, I ain't really into ya 

Chrous: 

To all the tramp goldiggers 
Keep it real y'all, gotta keep it real y'all 
Keep it real y'all, gotta keep it real y'all 
To all the misrepresenters 
Keep it real y'all, gotta keep it real y'all 
Keep it real y'all, gotta keep it real y'all 
To all the bitch ass niggas 
Keep it real y'all, gotta keep it real y'all 
Keep it real y'all, gotta keep it real y'all 
To all the tramp goldiggers 
Keep it real y'all, gotta keep it real y'all 
Keep it real y'all, gotta keep it real y'all 

I drop the lines above your mind y'all 
When I be comin' on that ill tip 
My whole crew pack nines, don't make me have to kill shit 
Uh, I bring the flavor to you ear 
Smash and trash MC's from the front to the rear 
In '95 until, I still kick the ill lyrical miracles 
Leavin' rappers hysterical 
I keep it raw and when I got the gat I hit'em all 
And on the M-I-C I rip'em all 
Yeah, word up, this is dedicated to my peeps 
on 6-0 and 6-1 on the Illedelphiatic streets 
Take it to the recently deceased 
H-Town, Tall D, rest in peace 
Word is bond, as the beat heat up 
Psychotic thoughts starts to lead up 
I got the sauce to make the Billboard bullet speed up 
Yo, word up, right on, Jamal gots the vibe y'all 
And that's the deal on the real, I gets ill y'all 
It's Philly's finest behind this doin' damage 
No matter how scandalous they can't handle this, handle what? 
Underground sound, I stick my dick in the ground 
And I turn the whole world around! 
And blow the sun up, word is bond, we blow the sun up 
Niggas they run up, tryin' to stop the come up and get done up 
Put your guns up, I blaze your buns up when I rock your spot 
Niggas they all stiff when the red dots to they knot 

Chorus x2
