                    Where Is The Love
Where Is The Love

We made it over sorrow
Every tear is dry
Mountains of emotion
Use to be so high
Now we stand in this forgiveness
But we`re missing just one thing
There`s a cut that ran the deepest
And the scar still feels a sting

Where Is The Love
We can`t do a thing about us
Without the crucial part 
Where Is The Love
We need it like air to breathe
Or we could fall apart
Where Is The Love
We see a new horizon
A second chance to be
Where Is The Love
What make us so strong together
The best of you and me
Where Is The Love

Where Is The Love
Where Is The Love
Where Is The Love

Apologies accepted
But we can`t get past the pain
We`re still together but not connected
No it`s not the same 
Now we stand in this forgiveness
But We`re missing just one thing 
There`s a cut that ran the deepest

Where Is The Love
We can`t do a thing about us
Without the crucial part 
Where Is The Love
We need it like air to breathe
Or we could fall apart
Where Is The Love
We see a new horizon
A second chance to be
Where Is The Love
What make us so strong together
The best of you and me
Where Is The Love

Where Is The Love
Where Is The Love
Where Is The Love

Where Is The Love
We can`t do a thing about us
Without the crucial part 
Where Is The Love
We need it like air to breathe
Or we could fall apart
Where Is The Love
We see a new horizon
A second chance to be
Where Is The Love
What make us so strong together
The best of you and me
Where Is The Love
