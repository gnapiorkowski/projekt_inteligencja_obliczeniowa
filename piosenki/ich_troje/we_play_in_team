Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    I.
Do you belive me when I say 
Your love is taking me away 
Everyday?

Cause I know nothing's forever 
But we’ll stay together 
And my arms are open wide 

Ref : (2x)
Cause we play in team 
We play together 
Reaching to the sky 
Cause we play in team 
Us forever 
We’re flying up so high 
Play in team

II.
I always want you by my side 
Cause you make me feel alright 
Just make me tight 

Cause I know nothing's forever 
But we’ll stay together 
And my arms are open wide 

Ref:(2x)
Cause we play in team 
We play together 
Reaching to the sky 
Cause we play in team 
Us forever 
We’re flying up so high 
Play in team

Play in team


We play in team ! 
We play together ... Go !
Everybody plays 
Play together !
Stand up stand up ! 
Everybody is flying!

Play in team 

Ref:(2x)
Cause we play in team 
We play together 
Reaching to the sky 

Cause we play in team 
Us forever 
We’re flying out so high 
Play in team
