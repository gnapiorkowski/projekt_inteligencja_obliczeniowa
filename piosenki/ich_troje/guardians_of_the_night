Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    Streets light turn the city on 
chaos comes alive
Sun is gone until the down
a Battle to survive
From a silence comes a sound
closing in on you
A tidal wave a rumble ringing true

We’re looking for souls
who can stand and fight
believe in a reason
to defend what’s right
Protecting a sound 
let it scream out loud
raise your hands together
We are the guardians of the night
whoa oh
We are the guardians of the night 
whoa oh

Walls of wires  rock it out
Rhythm burns a flame
Comes in like a thundercloud
a melody of rain
Hungry for security
shelter from the storm
We find the lost shattered broken torn 

We’re looking for souls
who can stand and fight
believe in a reason
to defend what’s right
Protecting a sound 
let it scream out loud
raise your hands together
We are the guardians of the night
whoa oh
We are the guardians of the night
whoa oh

We are warriors called to arms
hear the sound of our alarm
feel the fire of freedom
reaching out to you 

We’re looking for souls
who can stand and fight
believe in a reason
to defend what’s right
Protecting a sound 
let it scream out loud
raise your hands together
We are the guardians of the night 
whoa oh
We are the guardians of the night
whoa oh

Protecting a sound 
let it scream out loud
raise your hands together
We are the guardians of the night 
whoa oh
We are the guardians of the night
whoa oh
We are the guardians of the night
whoa oh

Raise your hands together
We are the guardians of the night
whoa oh
