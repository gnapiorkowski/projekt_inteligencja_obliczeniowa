Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    I gave a letter to the postman,
he put it his sack.
But in early next morning,
he brought my letter back.
She wrote upon it:
Return to sender, address unknown.
No such number, no such zone.
We had a quarrel, a lover's spat
I write I'm sorry but my letter
keeps coming back.

So then I dropped it in the mailbox
And sent it special D.
But in early next morning
it came right back to me.
She wrote upon it:
Return to sender, address unknown.
No such person, no such zone.

This time I'm gonna take it myself
and put it right in her hand.
And if it comes back the very next day
then I'll understand the writing on it
Return to sender, address unknown.
No such number, no such zone.
