Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    The first time that I ever kissed your lips
I felt a burning deep inside
I don't know what exactly happened next
But I recall a single word "Goodbye"

People come and people go
Some even stay for longer
Parting is a fact of life
You're free to go forever

I'll be here if you need a friend
Come around and see me again
But if you have to go
Don't say "Goodbye"

I have to realize what no one knows
Has ever made me feel before
I know that it's the first time and the last
A single word will bring me so much sorrow

People come and people go
Some even stay for longer
Parting is a fact of life
You're free to go forever

I'll be here if you need a friend
Come around and see me again
But if you have to go
Don't say "Goodbye"

People come and people go
Some even stay for longer
Parting is a fact of life
You're free to go forever

I'll be here if you need a friend
Come around and see me again
But if you have to go
Don't say "Goodbye"

Goodbye
