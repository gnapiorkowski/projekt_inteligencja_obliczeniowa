Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    There comes a time when everything goes wrong
And nothing helps you, neither drink nor song
Before you start complaining of your bad luck
See if you are sure there is nothing that can be done

Never call it a day before sundown
Don't throw tickets away before a ride
Don't cry over spilt milk getting your pint
Let the hands of the clock make one more round

Don't change partners until the music starts
Till you're sure you're dead don't call the cops
Never find a new man while I am around
If you feel you are wrong don't say all right

There is much more to life than silly games
You better cool it down and try to smile
Before you learn to keep your sorrows at bay
Let me tell you, girl, you should try and do it my way

Never call it a day before sundown
Don't throw tickets away before a ride
Don't cry over spilt milk getting your pint
Let the hands of the clock make one more round

Don't change partners until the music starts
Till you're sure you're dead don't call the cops
Never find a new man while I am around
If you feel you are wrong don't say all right

Never call it a day before sundown
Don't throw tickets away before a ride
Don't cry over spilt milk getting your pint
Let the hands of the clock make one more round

Never call it a day!
