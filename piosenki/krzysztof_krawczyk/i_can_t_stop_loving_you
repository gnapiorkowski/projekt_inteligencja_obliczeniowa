Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    I can't stop loving you
So I've made up my mind
To live in memories of old lonesome times
I can't stop wanting you
It's useless to say
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterday

Those happy hours that we once knew
Though long ago, still make me blue
They say that time heals the broken heart
But time is stood still since we've been apart

I can't stop loving you
So I've made up my mind
To live in memories of old lonesome times
I can't stop wanting you
It's useless to say
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterday
