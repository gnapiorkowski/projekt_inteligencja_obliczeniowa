Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    When I sit in my car 
And the rain is getting hard 
Giving your heads to the bad time 
I know how to drive 
Everybody gets my smile 
How can we find it together 
How can we find? 

I just wanna cut 
All the way through the mud 
You’d better let somebody stop me 
No way to reach home 
And it’s time to be gone 
Open the door 
Open the door 
And I will drive 

Since I know 
Every man is to fight all alone 
I’ll be the one who helps you realize 
Good news 
Oh, don’t turn your back on this love 
Answer 
Otherwise you’ll be drowned 
In this world 

Still the rain’s falling down 
Washing dirty streets of the town 
Taking all the scum 
(right) to the sewer 

I’ve so many rats 
Undisturbed by this flood 
Living so close together 
So many close 

I just wanna cut 
All the way through the mud 
Rain is not enough to protect you 
Don’t want to get stuck 
I’ll take you by my side 
Let’s run forever 
Let’s run forever 
Run forever 
Now 

Well I know 
Every man is to fight all alone 
La Mancha is my town 
I’m a knight, not a clown 

You fool man 
Don’t turn your back on this love 
Answer 
Otherwise you’ll be drowned in this world 

Since I know 
Every man is to fight all alone 
I am the one 
Who strives for his love all the time 

You fool man 
Don’t you turn your back on this love
