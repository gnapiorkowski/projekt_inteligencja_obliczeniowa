Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    Winding your way down on Baker street
Light in your head and dead on your feet
Well another crazy day
You'll drink the night away
And forget about everything

This city desert makes you feel so cold
It's got so many people but it's got no soul
And it's taking you so long
To find out you were wrong
When you thought it held everything

You used to think that it was so easy
You used to see that it was so easy
But you're trying, you're trying now

Another year and then you'll be happy
Just one more year and then you'll be happy
But you're crying, you're crying now

Way down the street there's a lot in this place
He opens the door, he's got that look on his face
And he asks you where you've been
You tell him who you've seen
And you talk about anything

He's got this dream about buying some land
He's gonna give up the booze and the one night stands
And then you'll settle down
With some quiet little town
And forget about everything

But you know you'll always keep moving
You know he's never gonna stop moving
'Cause he's rolling, he's the rolling stone

When you wake up it's a new morning
The sun is shining it's a new morning
And you're going, you're going home
