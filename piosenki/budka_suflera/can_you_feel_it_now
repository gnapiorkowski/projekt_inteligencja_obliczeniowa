                    Can You Feel It Now

I can`t dely, I face a mirror
You got to find a really heart carrier
Nice to show to spend a monkey elevecting movies
I got to go, the sunrise is waiting
You`d better call your mom to come help me
Don`t fall so easy for the strangers, selling all the goodies

Can you feel it now?
Sky is falling down
Can you feel it now?
Life going on like voices in the dark
And the heart is not shouting
The days are fully really coming
The nights of the wolf are really coming
The days of the cloud are really coming
The nights of the cards are here to...

Open the door and stare into nothing
I`m on the road to keep your part bumping
Lay back your memories, no more to see how it`s happened

I`m moving on, wasted behind me
I`m going home to escape the Red Army
ain`t your roof-top with the day glow
maybe I could spot it

Can you see it now?
Sky is falling down
Can you see it now?
Life going on like voices in the dark
And the heart is not shouting
The days are fully really coming
The nights of the wolf are really coming
The days of the cloud are really coming
The nights of the cards are here to...

I got to go, the sunrise is waiting
You`d better call your mama to help me
Don`t fall so easy for the strangers, selling all the goodies

I`m moving on, waisted behind me
I`m going home to escape the Red Army
Ain`t your roof-top with the day glow
Maybe I could spot it
