                    Seems I got to have a change of scenes 
Everynight I have the strangest dreams. 
Imprisoned by the way it could have been 
Left he are on my own or so it seemed. 
I got to leave before I start to scream, 
Before someone locks the door and takes to keys 

Feelin' alright, I'm not feelin' to good myself 
Feelin' alright, I'm not feelin' to good myself 

Boy you shelter me with warmth and rye 
And even now I sit and I wonder why. 
That when I think of you, I start myself to cry. 
Just can't waste my time, I must get by. 
Gotta stop believin', in all your lies. 
Well there's too much to do before I die. 

Feelin' alright, I'm not feelin' to good myself 
Feelin' alright, I'm not feelin' to good myself 

Ooh don't you get too lost, in all I say. 
In a better time, you know I really found that way. 
But that was then and now you know it's today... 
I can't get set for it, guess I'm here to stay. 
Till someone comes along and takes my place. 
With a different name, and a different face. 

Feelin' alright, I'm not feelin' to good myself 
Feelin' alright, I'm not feelin' to good myself
