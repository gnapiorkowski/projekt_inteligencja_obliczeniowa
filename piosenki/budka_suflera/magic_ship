Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    Over there is my magic ship
would you care to go on a trip
we'll be sailing on and on
to a land where few have gone
beyond the skies in my mind

Sweet bells ring and ring and ring you harmonies
rolling out like the waves on the sea
sweet bells ring and ring and ring your harmonies
rolling out to those who can see

Let's away to a distant night
let's away on a magic flight
we'll be sailing on and on
to a land where few have gone
beyond the skies in my mind

Sweet bells ring and ring and ring you harmonies
rolling out like the waves on the sea

sweet Bells ring and ring and ring your harmonies
calling out to those who can hear
Oh who can see
because were sailing

Sweet bells ring and ring and ring you harmonies
rolling out like the waves on the sea
sweet Bells ring and ring and ring and ring your harmonies
rolling out to those who can hear

Oh can you see
inside
don't be afraid,
step aboard
Oh, oh, oh, oh,
all right here we go
