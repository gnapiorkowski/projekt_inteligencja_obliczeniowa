Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    Give a little bit - 
give a little bit of your love to me 
I'll give a little bit - 
give a little bit of my love to you 

There's so much that we need to share 
So send a smile and show you care 

Gave a little bit - 
I gave a little bit of my life to you 
So give a little bit - 
give a little bit of your time to me 
See the man with the lonely eyes 
Oh take his hand you'll be so surprised 

Give a little bit - 
give a little bit of your love to me 
I'll give a little bit - 
give a little bit of my life to you 
Now's the time that we need to share 
So find yourself - 
we're on our way back home
