Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    Can you remember that summer night 
When you softly called my name 
You said: "Come if you can 
I’m feeling so bad"
Drove all night to be with you again 

Your husband was twenty light years from home 
Making money to buy one more car 
His letters, himself, distant and cold 
My passion and pride, like a star 

We laughed and we cried side by side, 
Breath to breath, heart by heart, hand in hand 
It's only the love
Was never so close 
As the waves left the tears on the side 

Throw me a lifeline
Draw me a heartline
Can you remember how we were before?
Throw me a lifeline
Draw me a heartline 
Once in a lifetime, long, long time ago 

Three nuns on the beach 
Watched the sun going down 
Your eyes can drift on the wave 
Besides you, between you 
Deep in your heart 
Falling heart to the end of the day 
We laughed and we cried side by side, 
Breath to breath, heart by heart, hand in hand 
You told me the love
Was never so close 
As the waves left the tears on the side 

Throw me a lifeline
Draw me a heartline
Can you remember how we were before?
Throw me a lifeline
Draw me a heartline 
Once in a lifetime, long, long time ago 

Can you remember that summer night 
When you softly called my name 
You said: "Come if you can 
I’m feeling so bad"
I came but I just couldn’t stay 

I don’t really know how it began 
And I don’t know why it died 
Love was coming 
Love was going 
I don’t sleep alone 
But something still hurts there inside
