Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    Moonless night in a small town 
Starless and Bible-black 
Boys dreaming of brave deeds 
Girls sleeping soft and silent 
Women forgiving their lovers 
Men being born to die 
Rebels raising their hands 
Pale snow covering their cry 

Prayers of water softly whispered 
Wind begins its stormy run 
Birds fluttering boys’ dreams 
About fighting to be done 
The brightness of the light 
Glowing on children’s faces 
Takes wind out of their sails 
Wind blowing away war traces 

Miracle of this night 
Rendering holy light 
Radiant infants’ hearts 
Please do no harm 
Don’t, don’t tempt them 
Look out 

Children know, much better know 
That the world is just a playground of God 
The Holy Infant dwells deep in your heart 
Let’s play with them 
With hope 
With faith 
With love 

Slings are thrown away 
Stones and sticks will make home 
Boys on rocking horses 
Enter the peaceful dome 
Where girls already wait 
And form a circle to dance 
Women expect new lives 
Men won’t be born to die 

Slings are thrown away 
Stones and sticks will make home 
Boys on rocking horses 
Enter the peaceful dome 
Girls greet boys with flowers 
Fragrant and sunny-light 
Together they run to the river 
Water washes them bright 

Miracle of this night 
Rendering holy light 
Radiant infants’ hearts 
Please do no harm 
Don’t, don’t tempt them 
Look out 

Children know, much better know 
That the world is just a playground of God 
The Holy Infant dwells deep in your heart 
Let’s play with them 
With hope 
With faith 
With love
