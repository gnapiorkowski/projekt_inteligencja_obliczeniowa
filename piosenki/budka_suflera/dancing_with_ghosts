Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    When you get 
there and 
you have time to spare- 
write me and say 
that you’re okay 

Home’s not the same-- 
When you left 
you took its name. 
Home is us-- 
Not me alone. 

I dance with ghosts now 
You know them all. 
I’m still in love 
With what we were 
(not what is now) 

I live in the past 
though we know 
memory won’t last 
candle flame- 
Tomorrow’s never the same 
-------------------------------------- Break 
And yes, I’m still 
angry at you-- 
For taking 
a precious thing 
that belonged to we two 

Leaving me, 
you stole something 
that wasn’t only yours— 

We made it together 
Not two hands, but four. 

I believed 
we were forever 

I believed 
in nothing more. 

Just me alone now 
dancing 
with our ghosts. 

Since you left 
I’ve learned to be 
their perfect host. 

I be-lieved 
we were forever 
I be-lieved 
in nothing more. 

I dance with ghosts now. 
You know them all 
I’m still in love 
With what we were 
(not what is now)
