Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    Tell me now, what's love today
The holy war's built a barricade
Between our hearts
Waiting for another day
I'm praying for peace on earth
But why would someone
Believe in death not life

Here I am
I wait for your love
Like an angel
I save light in my heart

Tell me now, if you can
Where was God
When you changed
Your guitar for a sword
I listen to the voice of earth
I feel her pain
When I hear her
Call for love
Like a child in the dark

Here I am
I wait for your love
Like an angel
I save light in my heart

Like a child in the dark

Here I am
I wait for your love
Like an angel
I save light in my heart
For us...
