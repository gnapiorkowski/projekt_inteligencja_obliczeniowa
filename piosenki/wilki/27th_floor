                    Hey, little girl. What are you doing here?
Hey, litle girl so lonely in the dark.
Red dress like a flower on the edge.
Tears like crystal birds, one step to die.

Never again blood on the street.
I don't want to feel the coldest kiss.
Night is so black, rain falling down.
Don't dance with death.
Stop it, stop!

Please belive in power of your heart.
Please belive in power of your mind.
Please belive me, this is not the end.
Please belive me, you can start again.

Hey, little girl. You've lost your dreams again.
Hey, little girl. So lonely in the dark.
No hope on the 27th floor.
On the tower of a suicide.

Never agin blood on the street.
I don't want to feel the coldest kiss.
Night so black. rain fall down.
Don't dance with deth.
Stop it, stop!

Please belive power of you're heart.
Please belive power of you're mind.
Please belive me, this is not the end.
please belive me, you can start again.

Try again...
