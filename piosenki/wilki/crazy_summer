Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    Wake me up when you go away
Maybe I go mad, but I wanna say
We have no way
Live on me till tomorrow

When you kiss (me) in the break of day
I feel your hair all over my face
I know I need you
Live on me till tomorrow

Let's try to run into the rain

Let's recall the glare of flame
Try to remind me day by day
Of that crazy summer

That hot crazy summer

Wake me up in the break of day
I wanna feel your hair on my face
Want to remind you
That hot crazy summer

That hot crazy summer

Where do we go now
Come on baby 
Where do we go 
My friend
