Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    Remember the time
when I was young
First touch and I really felt
the morning sun
Nothing to think of
while years pass by
I still remember
coolness of one winter night

It was before I pass the back door
Life seemed so easy in year 1974

Then came the day
And things have changed
Sadness and tears
Fulfilled my head 
I realized nothing the same
Smile upon my face
Finally disppear

It was before I pass the back door
Life seemed so easy in year 1974
It was beforde i pass the back door
Life seemed so easy in year 1974
Don't be afraid whiler passing that door
Some things have changed in year 1974
