Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    Feel so heavy, so heavy and so weary 
My arms are aching,, my head is breaking open 
All these people, they all want something from me 
My heart is aching, slowly disintegrating 

Paranoia 
So cold 

Night has fallen, there's just the moon and me 
Dragging myself up this dusty tower 
Body's covered, my body's covered in dew 
So much has happened, so much has happened to me
