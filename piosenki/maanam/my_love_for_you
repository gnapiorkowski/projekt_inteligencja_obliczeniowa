Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    I love you, my love, I love you 
I love you, and my love for you 
is a glade 
hidden deep in the forest 
I love you, my love, I love you 
I love you, and my love for you 
is an orchard 
drowsy and warm 

I love you, and my love for you 
is goodbye and hello 
and then the bells are ringing 
I'm on fire 
I love you 

I love you, my love, I love you 
I love you, and my love for you 
is your gaze 
gently blazing 
I love you, my love, I love you 
I love you, and my love for you 
is this yearning 
everburning 

I love you, my love, I love you 
I love you, and my love for you 
is your touch 
soft sensation 
I love you, my love, I love you 
I love you, and my love for you 
is this night 
of sleepless dreaming
