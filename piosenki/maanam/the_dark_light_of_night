Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    Saturn's fingers, sharp as night 
touch my soul, squeeze it tight 
the ice in my eyes,frozen screems 
the mind from th e north blovs cold on my dreams 
passing time drags me down to the floor 
then goes to see the man next door 
silent footsteps gently grieve 
slip my heart into my sleeve 

and the stars keep on blazing and spinning 
and gazing and grinning at me 

see my friends in my mirror 
looking weaker looking bleaker 
dead soul smiles, dead heart beating 
dead man's hand blindly greeting 
life just glides on by 
don't hope don't need don't cry 
don't trust don't lust don't dare 
don't hate don't love don't care 

and the stars keep on blazing and spinning 
and gazing and grinning at me
