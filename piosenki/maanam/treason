Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    Treason treason 
Cunning cold calculating 
Treason treason 
Darkly waiting infiltrating 

Each kiss contains its own betrayal 
Scratch me with your painted nail 
Sorrow slowly turns to dread 
Treason sneaks into your bed 

Treason treason treason 
The dead black eyes of the adder 
Treason treason treason 

Don't look for help, you're on your own 
Your lover loves another and won't come home 
Broken promisses broken light 
White is black, black is white 

Steady rhythm, even beat 
Don't talk back, turn the other cheek 
Keep it straight, keep it fair 
Talk out of line, if you dare 

Who can tell who is the traitor? 
Who is the lover? Who is the hater? 
Don't make me look, I don't want to see 
Is everyone a traitor or is it just me? 

Each kiss contains its own betrayal 
Scratch me with your painted nail 
Sorrow slowly turns to dread 
Treason sneaks into your bed
