Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    Shadows in the dark city 
Linger through the night 
Danger lurks by your doorway 
Don't turn out the light 
Sleep easy, don't worry 
Calm your timid soul 
Footsteps under your window 
It's just the night patrol 

Someone is dying 
Yours mother's crying 
Don't go out alone 
Evil is prowling 
The wind is howling 
Through your happy home 

Sleep, sleep, pretty baby, sleep 
Dream your dream of angels 
Rock-a-bye, baby, goodnight 

Shadows in the bleak city 
Night patrol's alert 
Making sure that you're OK. 
That you don't get hurt 
Anxious to protect you 
Everything's alright 
Shadows in the sad city 
Bleed through the night
