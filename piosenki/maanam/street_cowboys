Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    Enought imagination
To get you trought your life
Laughin louder
When you want to cry

Washed out in the rain
Dried out on the street

Your steely eyes are steady
Your teeth all flashing white
When it comes to talking
Keep your mouth shut tight

Clench up your fists
Your shoulders pushed back wide
Keep your mouth shut tight

Remember your mother’s smile
See you father’s face
Be tought enough
Through the nights and days
Remember your state of mind
When your heart attacks
Keep your self together
Street cowboys

Remember your mother’s smile
See your father’s face

Forget thoses schools that taught you
What is write, is wrong
A man, a home is always
Where he feels he belong

A man’s home is always
A man’s home is always
A man’s home is always
Where he feels he belong
Where he feels he belong
