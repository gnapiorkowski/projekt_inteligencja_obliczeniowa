Tekst piosenki:


In the dark of the night you feel that something ain't right 
don't be afraid.. afraid.. afraid.. 
Something has shone in the ground and it's hanging around 
don't be afraid.. afraid.. afraid..

O! O ! mental cat 
O! O! Yes, it's me
O! O! mental cat 

My fur is blue and bright I love to fly everynight!
Mental cat, Mental cat, Mental cat 
Don't be surprised by your eyes, remember I've got my lies
Mental cat, Mental cat, Mental cat 

O! O ! mental cat 
O! O! Yes, it's me
O! O! mental cat 

 (..................) I laugh to the tears 
Hey, boy, hey, boy! hold on! 
Look to the left now, look to the right now, 
look around yourself

O! O ! mental cat 
O! O! Yes, it's me
O! O! mental cat 

In the dark of the night you feel that something is not right 
don't be afraid.. afraid.. afraid..
Look to the left now, look to the right now, 
look around yourself

O! O ! mental cat 
O! O! Yes, it's me
O! O! mental cat
