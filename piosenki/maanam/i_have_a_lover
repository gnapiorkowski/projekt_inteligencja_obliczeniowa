Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    I have bread
You have meat
He has wine

We have raspberries
You have cherries
They have nuts

You had lemons
They had oranges
I have had figs

We had cake
You had pudding
They had ice-cream

If I have had beef
You could have had mutton
My friend could have had veal

You can have cheese
They will have eggs
Children must have milk

We may have turkey
Your friend will have pheasant

Then I can have coffee
You can have tea
My cousin can have cream

We could have salad
You could have sugar
They can have roots

So that we all could have salt
So that you all could have pepper
So that they can have vinegar

I have a lover
You have a lover
They have a mother-in-law
