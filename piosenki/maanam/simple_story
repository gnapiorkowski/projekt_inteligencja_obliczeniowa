Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    You whispered: Wait for me 
Be true, my love's for you 
The mystery, the calls, the letters 
Saving it all for you 

The seasons changed 
Your voice still sounds the same 
It's June again 
I've learnt to hide the pain 

And it's not you 
Kissing and touching me 
And it's not you 
I couldn't do what you wanted me to 

It's a simple story 
I'm so sorry 
I know it's too late 
And it was May 

I run to you inside 
With longing and regret 
Can't eat, can't sleep 
I can't forget 

You're everywhere 
Your voice still sounds the same 
The seasons changed 
It's May again 

And it's not you 
Kissing and touching me 
And it's not you 
I couldn't do what you wanted me to 

It's a simple story...
