Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    Enough imagination 
To get you through your life 
Laughing louder 
When you want to cry 
Washed out in the rain 
Dried out on the street 

Your steely eyes are steady 
Your teeth all flashing white 
When it comes to talking 
You keep your mouth shut tight 
Clench up you fists 
Your shoulders pushed back wide 

Remember your mother's smile 
See your father's face 
Be tough enough 
through the nights and days 

Remember your state of mind 
When your heart attacks 
Keep yourself together 
Red Cowboys Rule ok! 

Forget the schools that taught you 
What right is wrong 
A man's home is always 
Where a man belongs 
The world's just another place 
So go and try your luck
