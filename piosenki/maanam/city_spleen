Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    City shrouuded in cloud 
Sunless morning light 
Sleep down in my bed 
Sleep  down out of sight 
The air so heavy so heavy 
Dampness on my cheek 
Tatty ratty bird 
Dismal preening beak 

Morning afternoon 
The futile hours pass 
Foolish buzzing fly 
In the spider's grasp 
The sun so high so high 
Shining in the pilot's eye 
Tirelessly ablaze 
Burning in icy space 

I'm waiting right here for the wind 
To blow my shutters away 
Then maybe I can rise 
With the sun in my eyes 

The streets are shrouded in mist 
A key in every door 
Gaze out through my window 
Longing for the storm 
The sun so high so high 
Shining in the pilot's eye 
Tirelessly ablaze 
Burning in icy space 

I'm waiting right here for the wind 
To blow my shutters away 
Then maybe I can rise 
With the sun in my eyes
