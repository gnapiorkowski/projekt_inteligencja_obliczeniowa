Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    Here is my hand, you touch it and go 
Here are my lips, you see you need more 
Here is my body caressing and kissing 
All you can say is something is missing 

Your eyes are so gentle, your style is so cool 
But deep in your soul you're heartless and cruel 
I'm here when you want me, I go when you tell me 
What else can I do so I can be with you? 

My defences are down, right down to the ground 
But you still express your dissatisfaction 
My body is waiting, to use at your leisure 
All you can say is my pain is your pleasure
