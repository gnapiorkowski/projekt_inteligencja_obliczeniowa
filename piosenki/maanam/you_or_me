Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    Getting closer, closer, closer 
Day of equal possibilities 
Without protection, without lies 
Day of equal opportunity 

Who will be stronger, be stronger 
You or me 
Who will shine brighter, shine brighter 
You or me 

I will recall all my dreams 

What do you dream, if you dream 
Victim and killer 
You or me 

Who will be stronger . . . 

That will be a day of truth 
Without protection, without lies 
Mother will search for son 
in tears 

Only this . . . 
Who will be stronger . . . 

That will be a day of truth 
Sucked-up into a sea of stars 
Leaving millions of galaxies 
Who will shine brighter 
You or me
