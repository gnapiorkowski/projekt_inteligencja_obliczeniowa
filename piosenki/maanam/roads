Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    Waiting, waiting for something to get warmer 
Cruel shadows kiss my cooling body 
Smiles come rarely now 
Can't contain this longing 
Distant hopes glow dimly 
Bitter - sweet temptation 

Tears come rarely now, fever strikes like lighting 
Thunder drowns my heartbeat, ice curls round my spine 
Dark eyes getting darker 
Can't contain this longing 
Distant hopes glow dimly 
Bitter - sweet temptation 

Don't need faith without love 
Don't need love without desire 
Summer ends so very quickly 
Don't need love without fire 

Slipped through so many lives 
So many hearts, so many roads 
Don't know which way to go 
Some were warm, but some were cold 

Love tastet like opium 
Surrencer, sweet surrender 
Dark nights burn so brightly 
Time just fades away 
Time just fades away
