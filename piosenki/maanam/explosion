Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    Life is a set of structures, the tree and the lizard 
Spellbound, ocean water, deep blue sleep 
Furnace inferno blazing securely 
The earth (hear how it whispers!) trips its swift ellipses 

Explosion 

The sweet air takes on any shape that it wants to 
I can't change at all, however much I want to 
Side by side, peaceful until 
Anger's formless substance explodes in our faces 

Explosion 

Who can subdue the ocean's heaving power? 
Who can return lava to the volcano? 
Who can deliver me from the prospect 
Of strictures and structures and futures whitout futures? 

Explosion
