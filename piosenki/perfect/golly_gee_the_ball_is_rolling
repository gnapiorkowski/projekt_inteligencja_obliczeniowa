                    One, two, three!

Who got limo, who got palace?
Who built Vegas, who made Dallas?
Who won battles, who was beaten?
Who need speeches to be written?

Golly Gee the Ball is Rolling
Monkey's jumpin', boss is calling
Some computer chips are stolen
Man, a whiskey, what a jazz!
Five, four, three, two, one, ignition
What a perfect demolition
Blasted out without permission
Fire, water, what a jazz!

Who am I allowed to talk to?
Where am I supposed to go to?
Who'll be calmer, who'll be tenser?
Who will be this weekend's censor? 

Golly Gee the Ball is Rolling    
Monkey's jumpin', boss is calling
Some computer chips are stolen
Man, a whiskey, what a jazz!  
Five, four, three, two, one, ignition 
What a perfect demolition    
Blasted out without permission
Fire, water, what a jazz!

Who's found guilty for no reason
Who would rather stay in prison 
Who will praise me, who will lower?
Who will kill this rock'n'roller?

Golly Gee the Ball is Rolling    
Monkey's jumpin', boss is calling
Some computer chips are stolen
Man, a whiskey, what a jazz!  
Five, four, three, two, one, ignition
What a perfect demolition
Blasted out without permission
Fire, water, what a jazz!
