Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    You tell lies
Thinking I can't see,
You can't cry
"Cause you're laughing at me.

I'm down,
I'm really down,
I'm down, down on the ground,
I'm down,
I'm really down.

How can you laugh
When you know I'm down?
How can you laugh
When you know I'm down?

Man buys ring,
Woman throws it away
Same old thing happens
Everyday.

I'm down,
I'm really down,
I'm down, down on the ground,
I'm down, I'm really down.

How can you laugh
When you know I'm down?
How can you laugh
When you know I'm down?

We're all alone
And there's nobody else.
You'll still moan
"Keep your hands to yourself".

I'm down,
I'm really down,
I think I'm down, down on the ground,
I'm down, I'm really down

How can you laugh
When you know I'm down?
How can you laugh
When you know I'm down?

I'm down
I'm really down
I'm down
I'm really down
I'm down
I'm really down
I'm really down
I'm really down
I'm really down.
