                    Hey mama, don't you treat me wrong
Come and love your daddy all night long
All right, hey hey, all right, what I'd say
See the girl with the diamond ring
She knows how to shake that thing
All right, hey hey, all right
Tell your mama, tell your pa
I'm gonna send you back to Arkansas
All right, hey hey, send you back to Arkansas
I'll say all right, ummm all right
................., do the boogie woogie all night long
All right, what I'd say, tell me what I'd say

Hey, hey
Oooh, oooh
Hey, hey, oooh, oooh
Hey, hey, oooh, oooh
Tell me what I'd say
Tell me what I'd say
Tell me what I'd say
Tell me what I'd say
