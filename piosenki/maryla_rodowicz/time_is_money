Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    I don't care who's bound to glory,
I just try to live my story,
I like to spend my Sunday mornings,
On a beach,
I don't know where my life is going,
I don't care for such kind of knowing,
I'm doing all that  I can,
But everybody knows that  I'm rich.

Who said the time is money?
Who cares, it's fun it's funny?
I have some time and money,
But I've got my whole life to plan.

Who said the time is money?
My peace it got no money,
My private time is money,
And then go have fun until the end.

I'm not a kind of girl that's easy,
It's so hard to make me smile and tease me,
I like it a lot when something new knocks on my door,
I don't know when my train finds the station,
But I know that I'm alwyas patient,
I got no reason to hurry,
When  everybody knows that I'm poor.
Who said the time is money?
Who cares, it's fun it's funny?
I have some time and money,
But I've got my whole life to plan.

Who said the time is money?
My peace it got no money,
My private time is money,
And then go have fun until the end.
