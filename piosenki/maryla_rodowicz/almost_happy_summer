Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    It was almost happy summer,
Just walking down the Lovers Lane,
With no troubles waiting out ahead,
But a few drops of summer rain.

It was almost happy summer,
With only blue skies high above,
We were walking slowly through the grase,
Full of happiness, full of summer love.

All those fine days,
Lord, where they went?
All those warm nights,
Why do they end?
All those blues skies changing to grey,
Gone are days when I thought you'd stay,
All those blues skies changing to grey,
Love went by, never meant to stay.

It was almost happy summer,
And all the neighbourhood was hot,
We just hope we'll be a happy pair,
But that's exactly what we are not.
It was almost happy summer,
With me and you in paradise,
Many summers up and gone since dawn,
What have I done to pay the price?

Oh those fine days, Lord where they went?
Oh those warm nights, why did they end?
Oh trose blue skies changing to grey,
Gone are days when I thought you'd stay.

Oh those  fine days just passed us by,
No one knows them but you and I,
Oh those blue skies changing to grey,
Love will find better men to stay.
