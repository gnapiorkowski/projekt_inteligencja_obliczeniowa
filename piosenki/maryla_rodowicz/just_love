Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    One little move of a finger,
Makes some of pretty girls go,
May go for love that can linger,
Even when hurricanes blow,
Somewhere the true love is flying,
Over the sea and the land,
Give me one kiss,
And You hide,
The world where,
You can hold my hand.

What makes us do to be true?
Just love, just love...
What makes us feeling like new?
Only love, just love,
What makes us feeling so strong?
Just love, just love...
What brings us back what is gone?
Only love, just love...

One little wink of your eyebrow,
Makes some of pretty girls smile,
When can a guy jist like you go?
Look for my love for a while,
What makes us do to be true?
Just love, just love...
