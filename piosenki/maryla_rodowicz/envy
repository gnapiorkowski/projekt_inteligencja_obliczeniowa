Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    The worst of all is envy,
When you have it on your mind
You can hang your neighbors,
They got something you didn't find,
And your envy, it's your livin',
Slowly day by day,
It's frightenin'.

Anybody envies,
When somebody,
Has some more
It's so plain and easy,
As a hard knock on your door,
And your envy,
It's your feelings,
Slowly night by night,
This situation makes me,
Run and hide.

You can envy me,
I can envy you,
But we both must sail,
On this old boat.
I can envy you,
You can envy me,
Until the end,
We have to float,
You can envy me,
I can envy you,
Ant it all comes,
Next to none,
Don't you know,
The game is,
Always all the same,
Forget all your envy,
Life is fun.

Somebody's living,
While somebody tries to die,
I don't want us to crash down,
When the others learn to fly,
And our envy is all useless,
We can let it be,
The world is for the ones,
Like you and me.

You can envy me,
I can envy you,
But we both must sail,
On this old boat.
I can envy you,
You can envy me,
Until the end,
We have to float.

You can envy me,
I can envy you,
Ant it all comes,
Next to none,
Don't you know,
The game is,
Always all the same,
Forget all your envy,
Life is fun.
