                    They've never heard about the politics nature
Social security and social pressure 
Total indoctrination, prisons and war 
Some of You say there will be knowing more in future 
Go, go, go, go - into the future go, go! 
Into the future go! 

But now they know the love is a love 
Crying is a crying and love is a love 
Who is the mother and who is the father 
And how is to play with each other

So black is black and white is white 
Day is a day and a night is a night 
And all the things, it doesn't matter
In fact children know better!

And all the children love to play with the toys 
The boys with the cars, the girls with the dolls 
Nature is simple like in heaven stars
In fact more wisdom one hundred times 

And all the children love to play with the toys 
The boys with the cars, the girls with the dolls 
Nature is simple like in heaven stars
In fact more wisdom one hundred times 

So black is black and white is white 
Day is a day and a night is a night 
And all the things, it doesn't matter
In fact children know better!

Cause black is black and white is white 
Day is a day and a night is a night 
All the things, it doesn't matter 
In fact children know better! 

I tell you with the thrill of another children again 
There will be, be no things to the understand 
All the things, I tell you, doesn't matter 
In fact, I tell you, the children know better 
Cause they never heard about the politics nature
Social security and social pressure 
Total indoctrination, prisons and war 
Some of you say there will be knowing more

I say, I can't believe in that 
Look at that 
So I can't believe in that 
I can't believe in that 
Look at that 
So I can't believe in that 

Said, said, and all the children love to play with the toys 
The boys with their cars, the girls with the dolls 
Nature is simple like in heaven stars 
In fact more wisdom one hundred times 

So I can't believe in that 
Look at that 
So I can't believe in that 
Said, said, I can't believe in that 
Look at that 
So I can't believe in that 

Oh, black is black and white is white 
Day is a day and a night is a night 
And all the things, it doesn't matter 
In fact children know better! 

Cause black is black and white is white 
Day is a day and a night is a night 
And all the things, it doesn't matter 
In fact children know better!
Yeah!
