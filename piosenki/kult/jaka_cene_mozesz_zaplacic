Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    This crowd ain't no clean 
This crowd is dirty 
This crowd ain't no clean 
Say and it's so dirty 
This crowd smells no good living in it no easy 
You can find one man higher, the other on the bottom lays, I say 

What price could you pay for the freedom from society? 
What price could you pay for the freedom from society? 
What price could you pay for the freedom from society? 
I say! 

In this crowd I can't be with you 
You can't be with me, I say 
You can find one man higher 
Then other on the bottom lays, I say 

What price could you pay for a changing your destiny? 
What price could you pay for a changing your destiny? 
What price could you pay for a changing your destiny? 
What price could you pay for a changing your destiny? 
What price could you pay for a changing your destiny? 
What price, price, price could you pay for a changing your destiny? 
What price could you pay for the freedom from society? 
What price could you pay for a changing your destiny? 
What price could you pay for a changing your destiny? 
I say... 

What price could you pay for a changing your destiny?
