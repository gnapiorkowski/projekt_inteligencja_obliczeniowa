Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    Well...
I wake up at quarter to seven
Gonna buy some milk at seven eleven
Gonna catching first Central Line train
Day by day, again and again
They say walking is the sense of life
I see through the windows my new paradise
Catching first today's train
Day by day, again and again

Well...
(...) people don't look around
They love to be (..) and to read "The Sun"
Me in the middle, I've got on the top
Get the ticket on criminal record
I wake up at quarter to seven
Gonna buy some milk at seven eleven
Catch first today's train
Same train, again and again
Again and again
Again and again
Again and again
Again and again
Again

Well...
I wake up at quarter to seven
Buy some milk at seven eleven
Gonna catching first Central line train
Day by day, again and again
They say walking is the sense of life
I see through the windows my new paradise
Catch first today's train
Same train, again and again
Again and again
And again and again
And again and again
And again and again
Again and again
And again and again
And again and again
And again and again
Again and again
And again and again
And again and again
And again and again
Again and again
And again and again
Again and again
Again and again
