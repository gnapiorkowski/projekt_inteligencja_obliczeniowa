                    When I am the passenger 
And I ride and ride and ride 
I ride through the city's backsides 
I see the stars come out of the sky 
Yeah, the bright and hollow sky 
You know it looks so good tonight 

Oh, the passenger 
And he rides and he rides and he rides 
Oh, the passenger 
And he rides and he rides and he rides 
He looks through his windows surprised 
What does he see? 
He sees the winding ocean drive 
He sees the city sleep at night 
He sees the things he knows are his 
Over the city slept at night and 

And everything was made for you and me 
Cause it just belongs to you and me 
So let's take a ride 
And see your smile 

And singing la la la la lalalala 
La la la la lalalala 
La la la la lalalala la la la 

Get into the car 
We'll be the passenger 
We'll ride through the city by night 
We'll see the city slept at night 
We'll see the things we know are ours 
Over the city slept at night 
So let's ride and ride and ride 
And ride and ride and ride and 

And everything was made for you and me 
Cause it just belongs to you and me 
So let's take a ride 
And see your smile 
And singing la la la la lalalala 
La la la la lalalala 
La la la la lalalala la la la 

When I am the passenger 
And I ride and ride and ride 
I ride through the city's backsides 
I see the stars come out of the sky 
Yeah, the bright and hollow sky 
You know it looks so good tonight 

Oh the passenger 
And he rides and he rides and he rides and he rides 
Oh the passenger 
And he rides and he rides and he rides 
He looks through his windows surprised 
What does he see? 
Hey, he sees the winding, winding ocean drive 
He sees the city slept at night 
He sees the things he know are his 
Over the city slept at night and 

And everything was made for you and me 
Cause it just belongs to you and me 
So let's take a ride 
And see your smile 
And singing la la la la lalalala 
La la la la lalalala 
La la la la lalalala la la la 
And singing la la la la lalalala 
La la la la lalalala 
La la la la lalalala la la la 
Get into the car.
