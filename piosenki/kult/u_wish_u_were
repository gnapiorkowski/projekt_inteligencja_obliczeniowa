Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    You don't like the person, you say, who you are
Happy normal life and your abnormal wife
Those, those dreams you build in your imagination
Oh the (...) around you creates your frustration
No, no, no

You wish you were Robert Taylor
You wish your wife was Vivian Lee
You wish you lived another life
Another life for another guy

All your style of life, you say, you wanted more and more
There's no way out of here, yes I told you before
Those, those, those dreams you made in your imagination
You don't love your children they make your frustration
So, so, so

You wish you were David Bowie
You wish your wife was Patti Smith
You wish you lived another life
And doing things you've never done, you've never done

You wish you were Robert Taylor
You wish your wife was Vivian Lee
You wish you lived another life
And doing things you've never done, you've never done
You've never done, you've never done
You've never done, you've never done
You've never done
