Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    It was in 1979
I was a feeling good and felt all right
I've got my fist and believe in me
And Alan Minter against me
Oh no! Oh yeah!

I was beaten in the face, fingers into eyes
Nobody heard when my mother cries
Walking for money, money for bread
Angelo Jacopucci is dead!
Oh no! Oh yeah!

We like it
To do it now
We like it

And I've got a gun and I've got a fun
And I'll be the ruler of this land
I've got a gun and I've got a fun
So I'll be the ruler of this land
Oh no! Oh yes!

So, so, I stood in the dark, stood in the sea
I'm looking at my Love, You're looking at me
Which I have the desire to be like a fire
Open and see your eyes, open and see your tears
Oh no! Oh yes!

Go!

We like it
To do it now
We like it

We like it
To do it nooooooow!
