Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    There I was on a July morning 
I was looking for love 
With the strength 
Of a new day dawning 
And the beautiful sun 

With the sound 
Of the first bird singing 
I was leaving for home 
With the day 
And the night behind me 
Yeah! And the road of my own 

And the day 
And the resolution 
I'll be looking for you 
La, la, la, la-la 
La, la, la, la-la 
La, la, la... 

I've been looking for love 
In the strangest places 
Wasn't a stone 
That I left unturned? 
I must have tried more 
Than a thousand faces 
But not one was aware 
Than one I have 

In my mind 
In my heart 
In my soul 

La, la, la, la-la 
La, la, la, la-la 
La, la, la... 

... 

In my heart 
In my mind 
In my soul 

La, la, la, la-la 
La, la, la, la-la 

La, la, laaa... 
La, la, laaa... 
La, la, laaa... 
La, la, laaa... 

... 

Dziękujemy to wszystko na dziś 
Do widzenia!
