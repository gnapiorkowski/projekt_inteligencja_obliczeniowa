Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    Ula models for top magazines 
See her smile in her pink limousine 
Queen of lipstick, shampoo and suncreams, 
She's the fun of every man's dreams 
She thinks she's ooh-la-la, 
But she's just la-de-da 

Minus zero, minus zero, minus zero, minus zero

Flies to Rio when Rio is sunny 
Never sweats,'cause she stands in the shade 
She's a honey, and brings in the money 
Works for pleasure, but always gets paid 
She oozes sex appeal, 
But she just isn't real 

Minus zero, minus zero, minus zero, minus zero

Ula models for top magazines 
See her smile in her pink limousine 
Queen of lipstick, shampoo and suncreams, 
She's the fun of every man's dreams 
She thinks she's ooh-la-la, 
But she's just la-de-da 

Minus zero, minus zero, minus zero, minus zero

Minus zero, minus zero, minus zero, minus zero
