Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    Sometimes I've just had enough 
And I feel that life is kinda tough 
Maybe I could work it out 
But there's nothing that I care about 

I'm just a stranger 
I'm just a stranger here; no one near 
I'm just a stranger 
I'm just a stranger here; I live in fear 

Sometimes someone says to me 
You need love and maybe sympathy 
Maybe I could find my way 
But there's no one that I love today 

I'm just a stranger 
I'm just a stranger here; no one near 
I'm just a stranger 
I'm just a stranger here; I live in fear
		    
		    
                    Â
