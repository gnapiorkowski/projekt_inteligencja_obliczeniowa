                    CHORUS:

We know what you’re doing
We know what you’d like us all to believe
We know where we’re going
We’re all not blind, you know, some can see

VERSE 1:

You say I can be a millionaire
C’mon man you’re going nowhere
See my diamond rings, they shine
This all can be yours, it just takes a little time
Limo’s waiting right outside
Don’t be afraid, I’ll just stay here for a little ride

But I don’t know why
You don’t know, oh!
It’s so obvious
The writing’s on the wall
How can you walk so tall?

CHORUS:

We know what you’re doing
We know what you’d like us all to believe
We know where we’re going
We’re all not blind, you know, some can see

VERSE 2:

I know you’re gonna take it someday
Cuz you know I’ve got the only way
I know you with all your little dreams
If you wouldn’t sulk, better follow my scheme
Take my advice now, it’s no lie
There’s only one way, you’ve got to be sly

But I don’t know why
You don’t know, oh!
It’s so obvious
The writing’s on the wall
Careful, don’t fall!

CHORUS:

We know what you’re doing
We know what you’d like us all to believe
We know where we’re going
We’re all not blind, you know, some can see

BRIDGE:

Who are you fooling?
Fooling you are
Fool ya ya, fool ya
Fool ya ya ya

CHORUS:

We know what you’re doing
We know what you’ d like us all to believe
We know where we’re going
We’re all not blind, you know, some can see
