                    Hey you, what's your problem?
Are you looking for a man?
So just take a little number
And I'll be with you as soon as I can
Sir...

I'm so real about it
But I really don't know the reason
I'd like to talk about it 
But I really don't find it pleasing

Ref.:
So everybody
From everywhere
So everybody
Come on with me
I know the way

They all think I'm greedy
My only interest is in the money
But I don't believe it
And I rather think it's kind of funny

Ref.

You know it's not so easy
I'm not looking for your pity
It's already answered
On top it's not so pretty
