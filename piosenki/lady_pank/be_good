Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    Didn't want to make trouble
I just wanted to try and see
If I could burst your bubble
'Cause you looked so nice to me
When I touched you, you shivered
But I thought things would be OK
Thought I'd drown in your river
But you had something else to say

"You shouldn't be naughty
You shouldn't be so bad
You shouldn't be naughty
You shouldn't get up to no good"

Didn't think that you meant it
So i gave you another squeeze
Didn't think you'd resent it
But you still kept on saying to me

"You shouldn't...

"You're so bad" is all you can tell me
"Be a good boy" is all you can say
"Don't be wicked" is all you keep saying
"Don't be naughty that way!"

Didn't want to make trouble
I just wanted to play some games
Needed someone to cuddle
But you kept on saying the same

"You shouldn't...
