Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    My throat is bare, there's a sense of danger; 
I feel a hand, 
And the hand is strange. 
The hand is dead, 
Red blood on my hand; 
And as you die, 
I don't feel your pain. 

Where am I now ? 
What is this crowd - 
Of creatures all around me ? 
What can I do inside the zoo 
The zoo that has no keeper ? 

The dogs of war score and reassemble; 
Their fangs go deep; 
Sleep is blind to pain. 
I feel their breath, 
Death is no stranger; 
The vulture soars, 
Claws tear out my eyes. 

Where am I now ? 
What is this crowd - 
Of creatures all around me ? 
What can I do inside the zoo 
The zoo that has no keeper ? 

There's no way out of this jungle 
Just no way out of this jungle. 

Outside my door four men are waiting; 
They have the same names, 
But no one knows; 
The light goes out, 
I shout, but no one hears me; 
I feel a hand, 
And the hand is strange. 

Where am I now ? 
What is this crowd - 
Of creatures all around me ? 
What can I do inside the zoo 
The zoo that has no keeper ?
