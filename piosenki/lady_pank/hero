Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    You are a hero, you are a god, 
The crowd is always with you, 
Waiting for your nod. 
The morning papers always 
Have something you to say, 
The stakes are very high 
In the game you want to play. 

You touch the button 
With your trembling hand; 
The castles you are building 
Are made of sand. 

You walk on water, 
You play with fire; 
You'll lose the game you're playing, 
Unless the stakes go higher. 
You know exactly when 
Things could go too far, 
But no one seems to wonder 
Who you really are. 

You touch the button 
With your trembling hand; 
The castles you are building 
Are made of sand. 

They're made of sand/ 2x 

Records that you play 
Go on without you; 
Things are moving fast, 
What can you do ? 
Give the wheel another spin 
In your tower 
Make it look like things are still 
In your power. 

You touch the button... 

They're made of sand./2x 

You touch the button... /2x 

Are made of sand. 
They're made of sand./x3
