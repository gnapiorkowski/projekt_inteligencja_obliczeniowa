Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    The lights go down again
The end of one more show
Groupies gather 'round again
I wonder what they want
"Let's have a party" someone says
I guess I'll have to go
The things that I do for
The sake of Rock'n'Roll

This life is killing me
Kilimanjaro is where I'd like to be
Kilimanjaro - the air is cool and sweet
Kilimanjaro - no one to bother me
Kilimanjaro

I wake up feeling bad
In some new stranger's arms
Who are you ? What's your name ?
Do you like to dance ?
Last night is hanging over
Right into today
She says she used to pray
But someone stole her pants!

This life is killing me
Kilimanjaro is where I'd like to be
Kilimanjaro - the air is cool and sweet
Kilimanjaro - no one to bother me
Kilimanjaro
