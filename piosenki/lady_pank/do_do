Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    You take no notice of the words I say 
Of the words I say 
Whose generation is it anyway ? 
Just because the words that you hear 
Come from yesterday 
Doesn't mean that they don't mean the same, 
They still mean the same, still the same 

Do, do, do you realize that things just haven't changed ? 
Do, do, do you recognize Jumping Jack Flash in pain ? 

It doesn't matter if the cap won't fit, wear it anyway 
Simple things that you used to say 
Didn't fade away 
Times are changing, but they're still the same 
I still can't explain 
Twenty years or more have come and gone 
Life is still a pain, still a pain 

Do, do, do you realize that things just haven't changed ? 
Do, do, do you recognize Jumping Jack Flash in pain ?
