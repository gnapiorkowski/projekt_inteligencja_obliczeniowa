Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    You could scratch my itch 
If you were a little bolder, 
You could be my bitch 
If you were a little older, 
I could make you rich 
If you had a warmer shoulder. 
First I turned the switch, 
And then I rock and rolled her 

Hustler, 
I'm just a hustler, I'm just a hustler, 
I'm just a hustler. 
Did you think I would stay 'till tomorrow ? 
Did you think I'd repay what I borrowed ? 

You could be my key 
If you knew the combination, 
You could come with me 
If you knew my destination, 
I could set you free if you had imagination. 
I didn't let her see my cold premeditation. 

Hustler, 
I'm just a hustler, I'm just a hustler, 
I'm just a hustler. 
Did you think I would stay 'till tomorrow ? 
Did you think I'd repay what I borrowed ? 
Did you think I would care 
About your sorrow ? 

I'm just, I'm just a hustler. 

You could scratch my itch... 
I could make you rich... 

Hustler, 
I'm just a hustler, I'm just a hustler, 
I'm just a hustler. 
Did you think I would stay 'till tomorrow ? 
Did you think I'd repay what I borrowed ? 
Did you think I would care 
About your sorrow ? 

I'm just a hustler, I'm just a hustler
