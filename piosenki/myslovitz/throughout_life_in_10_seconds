Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    With all haste 
I must chase and catch my time 
Things keep speeding, so do I 
There's your face 
Don't remember when and how 
You mean nothing to me now 
All this world 
Comes close behind me, bites my neck 
Fits of furry - daily bread 
I must run 
I'm exhausted and I'm stunned 
Devastation! Sense is gone 
Wish I had 
Time to rest 
Listened to 
Driving rain 
I get lost 
Now, supersonic is my speed 
And I'll soon be smashed to bits 
How it kills 
I fall unconscious, I can't get up 
I'm not good for this, I think 
Wish I had 
Time to rest 
Listened to 
Driving rain 
I'd sit in the street 
That's the way 
Only me 
Nothing else
