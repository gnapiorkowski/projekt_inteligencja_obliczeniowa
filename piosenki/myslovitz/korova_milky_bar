Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    School and work and death 
I'll go frantic soon 
Such an ugly day 
I can't stand no more 
And I feel like scum 
No worth 
No luck 
No chance 
I'm just something like 
A mains device 

Mother Night, at last 
Korova Milky Bar 
Cocktail made of grass 
Indoor chemicals 

And I've opened up 
To time 
To you 
To Earth 
And I love you all 
And us 
And Earth 

What's your name, what stuff 
Did you take today? 
Panoramix Hash... 
Acid Teddy Bear... 
The reality 
Is like a huge black hound 
Creeping silently 
To eat me up 

Where am I now? 
Are you here? 
I've gone crazy 
I've gone weak 
My brain's drying 
Help me please!
