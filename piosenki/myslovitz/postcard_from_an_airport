Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    Rain in New York now 
Laugh in London town 
Fuck it all, fuck it all, fuck it all 
When you are gone 

Yeah, I brought no shots 
Of those beauty spots 
And whenever I roam 
I feel I must go home 
Fuck it all, fuck it all, fuck it all, fuck it all 
When you are gone I feel like 
I'm asleep, I'm lost a bit 
Disolved in mist 

Yeah, I have no more fun 
When I'm in this strange state of mind 
State of mind 

See, I've recall that here am I 
Sitting all alone, all alone 
You're all gone
