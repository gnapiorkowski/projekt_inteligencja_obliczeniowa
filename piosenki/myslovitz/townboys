Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    All the boys, they wander 
Around the blocks, each evening 
Just seeking something 
Killing time once again 
See them throwing pebbles 
At the wheels of sports cars 
And looking at the minis 
Of girls who don't care about them 

All the boys, they wander 
Around the blocks, each evening 
'cause in the evening 
You can't see the greyness 
The dirty streets are shadowed 
And the lampposts are broken 
And you can pretend 
That you've really gone for a walk 

All the boys, they wander 
Around the blocks, each evening 
They dream of living 
In lands of distinction 
Staring at the empty 
Binoculars of bottles 
They discuss all-American 
Motion pictures 

All the boys, they wander 
Around the blocks, each evening 
Or sit along the pavement 
Smoke joints for pleasure 
All their efforts to flee 
Become stronger 
When they really can 
It's too late 
They can't move any longer
