Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    For you I could do it all
Just tell me what you want
There's really much I can afford

For you I could alter things
I'd even rethink my beliefs
There's really much I can afford

For you I always pick wild flowers
I seek those rare for hours
There's really much I can afford

I'd love to lock you up in a cage
'Cos I love to gaze at your face
There's really much I can afford

That's all I want right now
That's all I just fail to find
That's all I need, and I
Won't get it in my life

Eyes wide open, check this out
There's fog around

For you I could do it all
Just tell me what you want
There's really much I can afford

You caused me
To suffer from big depression
I don't know who I am at present
But here's really much I can afford

That's all I want right now
That's all I just fail to find
That's all I need, and I
Won't get it in my life

Eyes wide open, check this out
There's fog around

I close my eyes
I need not see and need not sense
If this is the end, this is the end
