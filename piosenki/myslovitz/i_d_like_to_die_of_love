Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    All the world has slipped out of my grasp 
And as yet I can feel no regret 

Tell me how you'd like to live 
I'm alive and I think 
I want to live my life but... 

If I had to and I could ever make 
My death-wish 
It's not a secret and I know it well 
I'd like to die by your side 

Breezes blow, I smell springtime and know 
That you easily accepted what I'd said 
And... 

If I had to and I could ever make 
My death-wish 
It's not a secret and I know it well 
I'd like to die by your side 

And if ever I could really choose 
How to do that 
It's not a secret and I know it well 
I'd like to die of love 

In no armchair 
In no dream 
Not in peace and 
Not by day 
Not too easy 
Not in long years 
I'd like to die of love 

Not so painless 
Not in my home 
Not too quickly 
Not too young and 
Not too happy 
Not with my dears 
I'd like to die of love
