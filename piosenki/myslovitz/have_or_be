Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    Lust for experiences and fear of flying,
The shame of saying : I know nothing.
Imagination full of power,
It ain’t by chance that we're staying each other.


And now I know,
It’ll last, but just is long,
as you care.
It’ll last and you will aware,
That we stop falling when this life,
No longer count, no longer sound,
Like daily amazement.


Another question “have or be?”
-Did Erich Fromm know how to live?
Within  the world of constant dealing,
Where “be” can never have any meaning.
