Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    I, solid ice 
Stroke your hand, my touch is cold 
I, before your eyes 
Tell you lies, day in, day out 
Somehow, you 
Seem to know me well 
Every mask I wear 
You forgive me all 
That I bear the blame for 

I, one of you 
Cunning smiles flash on my face 
I, love playing games 
Otherwise, I'd miss my chance 
You, seem to know me well 
Every mask I wear 
You forgive me all 
That I bear the blame for 

You, the best of all the girls 
So let the poems rest 
No longer I'm afraid 
That I bear the blame, now 

You, seem to know me well 
Every mask I wear 
You forgive me all 
That I bear the blame for 

You, oh, you're the best of all 
Your long black overcoat 
Rain falling down 
On and on...
