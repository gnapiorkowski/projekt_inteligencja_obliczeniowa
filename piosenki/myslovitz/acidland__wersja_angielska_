Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    No, don't give up and take life as it is
  Think there's no chance
  That you would live again

  Why so much stress?
  Don't you have gains to get?
  We all do, even you!
  And the more you seek
  The more you find, then
  Love, night and rain - life is good
  So try to luck and kill the pain
  Tell me, do you always think you have no worth?
  Find it in yourself!

  No, don't give up and take life as it is
  Think there's no chance
  That you would live again

  This world's like a psychodelic trip
  You can't change anything
  Go and make use of it
  Your life belongs to you, yourself
  Make more mistakes now and make up for them
  And when you're down you will rebound
  Bravely use your time
  Or you may miss your only chance

  No, don't give up and take life as it is
  Think there's no chance
  That you would live again

  So take a breath and think again
  Life can make sense
  Just take it all the way it is

  So push and change and try again
  Go forward safe
  And take life all the way it is

  Do change your life, stand up and fight
  Go forward safe
