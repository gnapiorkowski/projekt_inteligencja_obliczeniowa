Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    The computer purr and the shining screen

Here the real world cannot every win

Cause you want a sex or a football game

Sounds better here than the very real thing



Flirting on a net, password: snowy bear

Just know a fault an you've got in yourself

And a pill of speed helps you live again

No tomorrow comes, tomorrow it's the same...


My often distinct voice

Can make you run away

And breathing some fresh air

All in the rain

And you must run and run

Until you out of breath

No point in coming back



Close of gadgets all, all you have in life

Tell me what the way you would like to live

When you change your world in the dreams one time

You won't find yourself, nobody ever will



My often distinct voice

Can make you run away

And breathing some fresh air

All in the rain

And you must run and run

Until you out of breath

No point in coming back


My often distinct voice

Can make you run away

And breathing some fresh air

All in the rain

And you must run and run

Until you out of breath

And you should not come back
