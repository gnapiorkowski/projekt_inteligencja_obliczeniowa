Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    I'm opressed by your own burden 
And genetically determined 
I feel weak and doomed to failure 
I'm a shit to them 
And I seem to lose, as always 
In the crowd - I go unnoticed 
Yes, I guess I am unwanted 
See me fade away 

And I always have my head shaved 
I don't buy goods - I just take them 
There is nothing I can do 
Only evil things 
I hate being kind and patient 
As I love to cause aversion 
This is how well I was bred, and 
Frankly, I was not 

What should I do? 
What should I do now? - tell me 
Pray! 
What should I do today? 
Tell me what? 
What should I do? 
Just try and mend one thing at least! 
For a moment help me, please! 

I have followed that example 
Which you set to me so often 
Thinking it's the best and only 
Now I know it's not 
I would love to be like others 
All those pretty youths with talents 
And if only I could try once... 
But it can't be done! 

What should I do? 
What should I do now? - tell me 
Pray! 
What should I do today? 
Tell me what? 
What should I do? 
Just try and mend one thing at least!
