Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    She is lost in her eye 
In the pupil she falls 
To a tunnel 
Deep into her woods 
Secret and serpent-like 
Walks under the moons 
Under the bones 
The Iris sleeps under the snow 

She waits for a bus 
And snowflakes fall on her coat 
Alone as her thoughts 
They waltz with her nose 
And here comes the bus 
And they're gone 

She waits for a plane 
She wears high-heeled jets 
To scratch the sky 
But lipstick tatoos 
Don't hurt much enough 
To kill all those guys 
And break down this night 
Though somewhere inside 
It's salty and wild 
Endless and green 

Only your bus doesn't stop here
