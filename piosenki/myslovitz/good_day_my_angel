                    Good day my angel 
I'll great you with black and white 
What do you want more 
The day's too short and the night belongs to us 
In my eyes you can see 
Fear of your future 
In my soul there's no shelter 
Under your wings shadow 

Good day my angel 
I can hear your knocking at my gates 

Good day my angel 
I can hear your knocking at my gates 

Do you bring today happiness 
Or the ray may run to words the lie 
Spread your wings so that 
I would feel a piece of heaven 
Spread your wings so that 
I would feel no pain when I die 

Good day my angel 
I can hear your knocking at my gates 

Good day my angel 
I can hear your knocking at my gates 

Do you bring today happiness 
Or the ray may run to words the lie 
Spread your wings so that 
I would feel a piece of heaven 
Spread your wings so that 
I would feel no pain when I die 

Good day my angel 
I can hear your knocking at my gates 

Good day my angel 
I can hear your knocking at my gates
