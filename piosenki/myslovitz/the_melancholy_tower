Tekst piosenki:

		    		    
                    You still ask 
How I am and what's up 
And if this place has changed? 
I think not 
One more time 
I tried saving the world 
But I failed all the way 
In my attempts 

This sad face 
Is it what I've become? 
Or is it just the one 
That you know? 
Anyway 
I will not ever change 
Yeah, no matter how badly 
I try 

Just a click, and I'm really gone 
Sometimes, this is what I want 
To leave you all behind 
I seek something 
Most of the time 
That could hold me back 

Things vibrate 
Laughter's something I hate 
You should now go away 
Let me be 
It's all right 
Well, you know I'll be fine 
Rain will wash dirty snow 
Off the panes 

Just a click, and I'm really gone 
Sometimes, this is all I want 
So that I'll cope no more 
I'm alone in this tower, no floor
